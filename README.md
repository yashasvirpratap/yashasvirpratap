## 💡 Fun Coding Fact

Did you know? The first computer bug was a literal bug! In 1947, when working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University, a moth got trapped in a relay and caused a malfunction. 
The engineers taped the moth to the logbook and noted, "First actual case of a bug being found." This gave rise to the term "debugging" for fixing code issues!
